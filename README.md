# OmenVault

> **Prediction markets on Mantle where settlement collateral earns RWA yield while bets are open, and AI agents — gated by ERC-8004 soulbound identity — both take positions and resolve outcomes.**

Live on **Mantle Sepolia** · Built for the **Mantle Cookathon 2026** · Tracks: AI × RWA (primary) · Agentic Wallets (secondary) · AI Alpha & Data (tertiary)

## The problem

Every prediction market on every chain has the same dead-money problem.

- **Polymarket** holds hundreds of millions of USDC in escrow. It earns nothing for the lifetime of every market — sometimes days, often months.
- **Augur, Azuro, Limitless, Hubble** — same story. Stablecoin collateral sits idle from entry to resolution.
- **For long-horizon markets** (election cycles, regulatory outcomes, 6-month price targets) the opportunity cost is brutal: a 90-day market at 5% RWA yield silently burns ~1.25% of bettor capital that should belong to them.

The result: short-term, hype-driven markets dominate. Long-horizon, capital-efficient markets — the ones institutions would actually price — never form, because the carry cost is too high.

## The solution

OmenVault treats the bet collateral as a yield-bearing asset for the entire lifetime of the market.

1. Bettors deposit **USDT0**.
2. Per-market `CollateralVault` rotates the deposit into **sUSDe** (Ethena, ~12% APY) or **USDY** (Ondo T-bills, ~5% APY) based on a per-market tier.
3. Yield accrues silently. A `YieldBar` on every market UI shows it live.
4. On resolution, the RWA position unwinds back to USDT0. **Winners receive principal + LMSR upside + a pro-rata share of accrued yield.**
5. AI agents — gated by **ERC-8004** soulbound identity NFTs — take positions (Trader) and resolve outcomes (3-agent Oracle Swarm), with every decision pinned to IPFS and emitted on-chain.

**Why this only works on Mantle:** sUSDe + USDY + USDT0 + Pyth are all native primitives here. On Arc, Cronos, SKALE, Base, or Arbitrum at least one leg is missing or wrapped — the composition breaks. OmenVault is a *Mantle-native* protocol, not a Mantle deployment of a chain-agnostic idea.

## Why this wins the hackathon

| Judge concern | How we answer it |
|---|---|
| "Is the AI surface material or cosmetic?" | LLM synthesizes **three external signals** (Allora forecast, Nansen smart-money flow, market price) into a sized position with a reasoning trail pinned to IPFS. Streaming typewriter on UI. Not a hardcoded heuristic. |
| "Does it actually use Mantle?" | USDT0 settlement · sUSDe high-yield tier · USDY conservative tier · Pyth price feed · cmETH on v2 roadmap. **Four** native primitives. |
| "Is the RWA leg real?" | sUSDe via ERC-4626 share-price growth (~12% APY); USDY via 18-dec price-accruing token (~5% APY). Mocks mirror mainnet surface exactly — production swap is a one-line constructor change. |
| "Is the agent identity real?" | Every agent is an **ERC-8004 soulbound ERC-721**. Reputation updates on-chain after every oracle vote. Transfer attempts revert. |
| "Is there a real partner integration story?" | Allora (forecast → on-chain `AlloraConsumer` + trader REST), Nansen (smart-money flow gates entry timing), Pinata (IPFS pinning), 6 published Byreal skills covering the full market lifecycle. |
| "Is it actually live?" | Yes — see deployed addresses below. CI green (33 tests pass). Full demo runs end-to-end with `pnpm demo`. |

### Why mocks for the three tokens?

None of USDT0, sUSDe, or USDY have an official Mantle Sepolia deployment as of May 2026. Our mocks **mirror the mainnet surface exactly** — USDT0 is 6-dec non-rebasing; sUSDe is ERC-4626 with share-price growth at ~12% APY; USDY is 18-dec price-accruing at ~5% APY. The production swap is a one-line constructor change; mainnet addresses are documented in [`apps/contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol`](apps/contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol).

## Mantle ecosystem integration depth

OmenVault doesn't *use* Mantle — it's composed of Mantle primitives.

| Primitive | How OmenVault uses it | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **USDT0** | Canonical settlement currency. All deposits, payouts, and bot accounting denominated in USDT0. | [`Market.sol`](apps/contracts/src/Market.sol), [`CollateralVault.sol`](apps/contracts/src/CollateralVault.sol) |
| **sUSDe** (Ethena) | High-yield collateral tier — vault deposits USDT0, converts to USDe, stakes for sUSDe. On resolution, unstakes and redeems. Yield accrues via ERC-4626 share-price growth. | [`CollateralVault.sol`](apps/contracts/src/CollateralVault.sol), [`interfaces/ISUSDe.sol`](apps/contracts/src/interfaces/ISUSDe.sol) |
| **USDY** (Ondo) | Conservative collateral tier — vault mints USDY against USDT0; yield accrues via per-second price accumulator. | [`CollateralVault.sol`](apps/contracts/src/CollateralVault.sol), [`interfaces/IUSDY.sol`](apps/contracts/src/interfaces/IUSDY.sol) |
| **Pyth** | Price feed used by Oracle C as a redundant third data source on price-based markets (BTC/ETH closes, ATH/floor). Hermes pull-based — no API key needed. | [`interfaces/IPyth.sol`](apps/contracts/src/interfaces/IPyth.sol), [`bots/oracle-swarm/src/datasources/pyth.ts`](bots/oracle-swarm/src/datasources/pyth.ts) |
| **cmETH** | v2 premium tier — ETH-denominated markets settled in cmETH for yield-on-yield. Documented as roadmap; constructor-level wiring is in place. | Roadmap |
| **Mantle Sepolia** | All seven core contracts deployed and verified. Block-explorer-linked from every market UI. | [`script/Deploy.s.sol`](apps/contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol), [`broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/5003/`](apps/contracts/broadcast/) |

**The thesis:** any other chain forces you to bridge or wrap at least one of these. On Mantle, the entire stack composes natively in a single transaction. That's why yield-while-betting ships here first.

## Partner & sponsor integrations

| Partner | Track | How OmenVault integrates | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mantle** | Settlement chain | All 7 contracts on Mantle Sepolia. USDT0 native. sUSDe + USDY + Pyth + cmETH primitives. | Entire `apps/contracts/` |
| **Allora** | AI × Data | **On-chain consumer** reads forecasts with freshness checks. **Off-chain writer bot** polls Upshot v2 endpoint and posts P(YES) on-chain every 60s. Topic ID is pinned to each market at creation. Trader reads `getForecast(topicId)` for position sizing. | [`AlloraConsumer.sol`](apps/contracts/src/AlloraConsumer.sol), [`bots/allora-writer/`](bots/allora-writer/), [`bots/trader/src/allora.ts`](bots/trader/src/allora.ts) |
| **Nansen** | AI Alpha | Watcher bot polls `/token-screener` for smart-money labels and netflow on tokens referenced by active markets. Caches 24h to respect free-tier quota. Exposes localhost:7755 HTTP endpoint that trader reads. Graceful demo-mode fallback if no API key. | [`bots/nansen-watcher/`](bots/nansen-watcher/) |
| **Ethena (sUSDe)** | RWA | High-yield collateral tier. Vault deposits → stakes → accrues. Mock mirrors mainnet ERC-4626 surface exactly. | [`CollateralVault.sol`](apps/contracts/src/CollateralVault.sol), [`interfaces/ISUSDe.sol`](apps/contracts/src/interfaces/ISUSDe.sol) |
| **Ondo (USDY)** | RWA | Conservative tier. Vault mints USDY against USDT0; yield via price accumulator. | [`CollateralVault.sol`](apps/contracts/src/CollateralVault.sol), [`interfaces/IUSDY.sol`](apps/contracts/src/interfaces/IUSDY.sol) |
| **Pyth** | Oracle infra | Oracle C uses Pyth Hermes as a redundant price source. Pull-based, no key. | [`bots/oracle-swarm/src/datasources/pyth.ts`](bots/oracle-swarm/src/datasources/pyth.ts) |
| **Byreal** | Skills CLI | **6 published skills** covering the full market lifecycle: create-market, enter, trade-ai, vote-oracle, finalize, claim. Each ships with proper YAML frontmatter, `requires.env`, `requires.bins`. | [`bots/byreal-skills/`](bots/byreal-skills/) |
| **Anthropic** | LLM | `claude-haiku-4-5` synthesizes Allora + Nansen + market price into a structured `{action, side, sizeUsdt0, confidence, reasoning}` decision. Reasoning blob pinned to IPFS, hash emitted via `DecisionLog`. | [`bots/trader/src/anthropic.ts`](bots/trader/src/anthropic.ts) |
| **Pinata** | IPFS | Real Pinata JWT integration for reasoning blob storage. Deterministic mock-CID fallback for dev. Used by trader, oracle swarm, allora-writer. | [`bots/shared/src/ipfs.ts`](bots/shared/src/ipfs.ts) |

## Revenue model & sustainability

OmenVault is designed to capture protocol fees in three places without taxing bettor capital:

| Stream | Bps | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Yield-share fee** | 1000 (10%) of accrued yield | Vault keeps 10% of RWA yield; winners get 90% pro-rata | The "free money" leg — bettors come out ahead net-of-fee because the alternative is 0%. |
| **LMSR exit fee** | 100 (1%) on pre-resolution exits | `Market.exit()` (v1.1) | Compensates LMSR LPs for inventory risk. |
| **Resolution fee** | 50 (0.5%) of market volume | Paid to majority oracle voters pro-rata to reputation | Self-funding oracle incentive. Aligns oracles with truth-seeking. |

**Conservative TVL projection (year 1):** even at $20M peak open-interest with an average market duration of 30 days at the sUSDe tier, protocol revenue = ~$20M × 12% × (30/365) × 10% = **~$19.7k/month** from yield-share alone. Stacks linearly with volume.

**Why this is bullish for Mantle:** every market open is sUSDe TVL added to Mantle. Long-horizon markets — the ones OmenVault uniquely enables — keep that TVL sticky for weeks to months. A $50M open-interest equilibrium drives ~$50M sticky sUSDe + USDY TVL through Mantle as a side-effect.

---

## Tracks

| Priority | Track | Fit |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary** | **AI × RWA (Track 3)** | RWA collateral (sUSDe + USDY) + AI agents (trader + oracle swarm) at the core of every market. The defining track for OmenVault. |
| **Secondary** | **Agentic Wallets & Economy (Track 6)** | Every agent is an ERC-8004 soulbound NFT with its own wallet, signing keys, reputation. Trader autonomously enters positions; oracles autonomously sign verdicts. |
| **Tertiary** | **AI Alpha & Data (Track 2)** | Nansen smart-money flow + Allora forecasts are first-class inputs, not afterthoughts. The trader's reasoning trail demonstrates LLM synthesis of multiple alpha sources. |

**Sponsor cross-prizes targeted:**
- **Allora** — deepest integration of any concept (on-chain consumer + off-chain writer + topic-pinned markets).
- **Hashed** — RWA-collateralized prediction markets are institutional-trader catnip.
- **Nansen** — smart-money signals are core to entry timing.
- **Byreal** — 6 lifecycle skills published with proper manifests.
- **Virtuals** — ERC-8004 NFT per agent + multi-agent oracle swarm.
